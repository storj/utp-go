// OnReadCallback is the type of callback to be used when a socket has received
// application data from the peer. The callback will be provided with the

// of the data in the 'bytes' slice. Other methods on the Socket object, such
// as (*Socket).Write(), may be called while the callback is running, if
// appropriate.
type OnReadCallback func(userdata interface{}, bytes []byte)

// OnWriteCallback is the type of callback to be used when a socket is ready to
// send more application data to the peer. The application will already have
// indicated that it _wants_ to send some amount of data using the
// (*Socket).Write() method, but the data to be sent is not determined until
// this callback is made. The callback will be provided with the userdata
// parameter that was given when the callback was set (using
// (*Socket).SetCallbacks()). The callback is expected to fill in the entire
// 'bytes' slice. (It should be guaranteed that the slice will not be greater
// in size than the amount of application that is ready to be sent, as
// indicated by the last call to (*Socket).Write().)
//
// Once received, the µTP layer takes responsibility for delivering those
// bytes.
type OnWriteCallback func(userdata interface{}, bytes []byte)

// GetRBSizeCallback is the type of callback to be used when a socket needs to
// know the current size of the read buffer (how many bytes have been received
// by OnReadCallback, but have not yet been processed). This is used to
// determine the size of the read window (how many bytes our side is willing to
// accept from the remote all at once). If your OnReadCallback does not buffer
// any bytes, but instead always processes bytes immediately, this method
// can simply always return 0. The callback will be provided with the userdata
// parameter that was given when the callback was set (using
// (*Socket).SetCallbacks()).
type GetRBSizeCallback func(userdata interface{}) int

// OnStateChangeCallback is the type of callback to be used when a socket
// changes its socket state. The callback will be provided with the userdata
// parameter that was given when the callback was set (using
// (*Socket).SetCallbacks()). The 'state' parameter will hold the new state
// of the Socket. It may be important to provide this callback in order to
// know when a connection is established, and a Socket can accept data, or
// when a connection has been closed.
type OnStateChangeCallback func(userdata interface{}, state State)

// OnErrorCallback is the type of callback to be used when something goes
// wrong with a connection. Currently, the possible errors which cause an
// OnErrorCallback are syscall.ECONNREFUSED, syscall.ECONNRESET, and
// syscall.ETIMEDOUT. All of these probably need to be considered fatal
// errors in the context of the connection.
//
// The callback will be provided with the userdata parameter that was given
// when the callback was set (using (*Socket).SetCallbacks()). The callback
// is responsible for calling (*Socket).Close() if appropriate to tear down
// the connection.
type OnErrorCallback func(userdata interface{}, err error)

// OnOverheadCallback is the type of callback to be used when any data is sent
// over the network. Each byte is accounted by µTP into one of the
// BandwidthType data classes, and when sent, the use of that class of data is
// reported to the application using this OnOverheadCallback. The callback will
// be provided with the userdata parameter that was given when the callback was
// set (using (*Socket).SetCallbacks()). This callback can be used to maintain
// statistics about the amount of overhead used to communicate with µTP.
//
// (Use of the PayloadBandwidth BandwidthType is also reported to this callback,
// although strictly speaking it is not really "overhead".)

// Socket can have a different set of callbacks to call, if needed. Any members

// GotIncomingConnection is the type of callback to be called when a new
// incoming µTP connection has been established by the socket layer. The Socket
// for the new connection is passed as 's'. The new Socket can be considered
// connected and writable immediately.
//
// The callback will be provided with the userdata parameter that was given
// along with this callback in the corresponding call to IsIncomingUTP(). The
// callback is responsible for getting the Socket ready to do work; typically,
// this involves setting callbacks for it with (*Socket).SetCallbacks().
//
// If you want to reject the new connection, it may be closed immediately with
// (*Socket).Close().
type GotIncomingConnection func(userdata interface{}, s *Socket)

// PacketSendCallback is the type of callback to be used when the µTP socket
// layer wants to transmit data over the underlying packet connection (which
// is probably UDP). The callback will be provided with the userdata parameter
// that was given along with this callback in the corresponding call to
// IsIncomingUTP() or Create(). The callback is responsible for actually
// transmitting the packet to the destination address.
//
// The callback is allowed to buffer the outgoing data instead of transmitting
// it immediately, if desired, but the data should be transmitted as soon as
// feasible.
type PacketSendCallback func(userdata interface{}, p []byte, addr *net.UDPAddr)

// Stats collects statistics for a particular Socket when utp-go is built with
